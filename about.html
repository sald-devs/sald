  <p>
  SALD is an acronym for Studio A Ludum Dare. Sald was built by a group of around 15 students from Carnegie Mellon Univeristy
  as a part of a course called Game Engine Programming. This course is offered under CMU's <a href="http://ideate.cmu.edu/">IDEATE</a> program 
  which focuses on innovative and interdisciplinary education.
  
 In the first half of this course, all the students were involved in designing and developing different modules of this web based engine.
 In the latter half of the semester, we were divided into different groups to focus on student pitch projects. 4 of us were faced with the task of
 making Sald Ludim Dare ready! This gave us a chance to make sure that Sald can actually be put to use and Live On even after we complete this course.
 
 This involved adding in new modules like sound, polishing existing modules and providing proper documentation to support the users.
 
 We hope that you enjoy using Sald and create some Awesome games with it. Feel free to contact us and share your experiences <a href="mailto:sald.devs@gmail.com">Sald-Devs</a>
